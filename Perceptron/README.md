# Iris Flower Classification with Perceptron

In this project, I implemented a Perceptron model for the classification of Iris flowers using Python and the Iris dataset. The Perceptron is a simple machine learning algorithm capable of linear classification.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to demonstrate the implementation and usage of a Perceptron algorithm for the classification of Iris flowers based on their features, specifically sepal width and petal width.

### Code Structure

The project consists of the following components:

- **Data Loading**: Loading the Iris dataset using the `scikit-learn` library and preparing the data for training.

- **Perceptron Implementation**: The core of the project is the `Perceptron` class, which includes methods for model initialization, training, prediction, and weight/bias retrieval.

- **Data Visualization**: Visualizing the data points and decision boundary created by the trained Perceptron using Matplotlib.

## Usage

To run this project:

1. Ensure you have Python installed along with the necessary libraries (NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, and Matplotlib).

2. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/iris-perceptron.git
   ```

3. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd iris-perceptron
    ```

4. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to train the Perceptron and visualize the results.

## Results
After running the project, you will observe the following:

. The Perceptron model is trained to classify Iris flowers into setosa (1.0) and non-setosa (0.0) categories based on sepal width and petal width.

. The accuracy of the model on the dataset is displayed in the output.

. Visualizations show the data points and the decision boundary created by the Perceptron.

## About the Iris Dataset
The Iris dataset is a well-known dataset in machine learning. It consists of 150 samples of Iris flowers, each with four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The dataset contains three species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica.

## Credits
This project was developed as part of a machine learning learning journey and serves as a practical example of using a Perceptron for classification tasks.

Feel free to explore the code and modify it for your own projects. If you have any questions or suggestions, please don't hesitate to reach out.
