# Machine Learning and Deep Learning Projects

Welcome to my repository where I share my Machine Learning and Deep Learning projects as I learn and grow in this field. This repository primarily utilizes Python and Jupyter notebooks.

## About

In this repository, you will find a collection of projects that I have worked on while exploring the exciting world of Machine Learning and Deep Learning. These projects serve as both a learning experience for me and a way to showcase my progress.

## Projects

- **Project 1**: [Perceptron](https://github.com/Samuelsnv2/ML-learning/tree/main/Perceptron) - In this project, I implemented a Perceptron model to classify Iris flowers based on their characteristics using the famous Iris dataset. The Perceptron is a simple machine learning algorithm that can separate linear classes, making it an ideal choice for this task.


## Tools and Technologies

I primarily use the following tools and technologies:

- **Python**: The main programming language for implementing Machine Learning and Deep Learning algorithms.
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: Interactive notebooks for data exploration, analysis, and visualization.
- **Libraries**: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, etc.

## Getting Started

If you want to explore any of the projects or run the code yourself, you can follow the instructions in each project's respective README or Jupyter notebook.
