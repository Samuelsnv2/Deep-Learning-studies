# Machine Learning and Deep Learning Projects

Welcome to my repository where I share my Machine Learning and Deep Learning projects as I learn and grow in this field. This repository primarily utilizes Python and Jupyter notebooks.

## About

In this repository, you will find a collection of projects that I have worked on while exploring the exciting world of Machine Learning and Deep Learning. These projects serve as both a learning experience for me and a way to showcase my progress.

## Projects

- **Project 1**: [Perceptron](https://github.com/Samuelsnv2/ML-learning/tree/main/Perceptron) - In this project, I implemented a Perceptron model to classify Iris flowers based on their characteristics using the famous Iris dataset. The Perceptron is a simple machine learning algorithm that can separate linear classes, making it an ideal choice for this task.

- **Project 2**: [Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)](https://github.com/Samuelsnv2/ML-learning/tree/main/MLP) - This project focuses on implementing a Multilayer Perceptron, a fundamental type of artificial neural network. I trained the MLP on various datasets, exploring its capabilities in solving complex classification problems.

   - **Contents**:
     - `mlp_iris.py`: Implementation of MLP for Iris dataset classification.
     - `mlp_mnist.py`: MLP implementation for recognizing handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset.
     - `mlp_custom_dataset.py`: Training MLP on a custom dataset.
     
   - **Usage**:
     - Check out the individual Python files for specific usage instructions.
     - Required libraries: NumPy, Keras.

- **Project 3**: [Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)](https://github.com/Samuelsnv2/ML-learning/tree/main/CNN) - This project delves into Convolutional Neural Networks, a powerful deep learning technique essential for image recognition tasks. I trained CNNs on datasets like Fashion MNIST, exploring advanced architectures and techniques to enhance accuracy.

   - **Contents**:
     - `fashion_mnist_cnn.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the CNN model for Fashion MNIST dataset.
     - `test_fashion_cnn.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook to test the trained CNN model on custom images.
     - `image_test/`: Directory for storing custom images to test the CNN model.
     
   - **Usage**:
     - Follow the instructions in the Jupyter notebooks for training the model and testing custom images.
     - Required libraries: Keras, NumPy, Matplotlib.

## Tools and Technologies

I primarily use the following tools and technologies:

- **Python**: The main programming language for implementing Machine Learning and Deep Learning algorithms.
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: Interactive notebooks for data exploration, analysis, and visualization.
- **Libraries**: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, etc.

## Getting Started

If you want to explore any of the projects or run the code yourself, you can follow the instructions in each project's respective README or Jupyter notebook.
